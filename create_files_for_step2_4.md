The user has provided snippets for three files (one DTO, two Events, one Exception) that were part of my previous generation plan for Step 2.5 (Payment and Promotion domains). They are asking me to:
1.  Carefully review these snippets.
2.  Double-check and validate them.
3.  Create the complete and properly formatted, working versions of these files.
4.  Ensure consistency with previously created files.

Let's review each one:

**1. `app/Domain/Payment/DTOs/PaymentIntentResultData.php`**
   *   **Snippet:**
     ```php
     <?php
     declare(strict_types=1);
     namespace App\Domain\Payment\DTOs;
     use Spatie\LaravelData\Data;
     class PaymentIntentResultData extends Data
     {
         public function __construct(
             public string $clientSecret,
             public string $paymentIntentId,
             public string $status
         ) {}
     }
     ```
   *   **Review & Validation:**
        *   Namespace is correct: `App\Domain\Payment\DTOs`.
        *   Uses `Spatie\LaravelData\Data`, which is planned.
        *   Constructor uses property promotion, which is good for PHP 8.0+.
        *   Properties (`clientSecret`, `paymentIntentId`, `status`) are relevant for a PaymentIntent result.
        *   Types are string, which is appropriate for these values.
        *   `declare(strict_types=1);` is present.
   *   **Is it complete and working?** Yes, this DTO is simple and looks complete for its purpose. It's a data container.
   *   **Consistency:** Consistent with using Spatie DTOs.
   *   **Action:** The provided snippet is already complete and correct. I will re-present it cleanly.

**2. `app/Domain/Payment/Events/PaymentSuccessfulEvent.php`**
   *   **Snippet:**
     ```php
     // app/Domain/Payment/Events/PaymentSuccessfulEvent.php
     <?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\Domain\Payment\Events;
     use App\Domain\Payment\DTOs\PaymentResultData; use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable; use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
     class PaymentSuccessfulEvent { use Dispatchable, SerializesModels; public function __construct(public PaymentResultData $paymentResult, public ?int $orderId = null){} }
     ```
   *   **Review & Validation:**
        *   Namespace is correct: `App\Domain\Payment\Events`.
        *   Uses `PaymentResultData` DTO, `Dispatchable`, `SerializesModels` traits â€“ standard for Laravel events.
        *   Constructor uses property promotion for `paymentResult` (type-hinted to the DTO) and an optional `orderId`. This is good.
        *   `declare(strict_types=1);` is present.
   *   **Is it complete and working?** Yes, this event class is structurally sound and complete for its purpose.
   *   **Consistency:** Consistent with Laravel event structure and DTO usage.
   *   **Action:** The provided snippet is already complete and correct (just needs standard PHP tags). I will re-present it cleanly.

**3. `app/Domain/Payment/Events/PaymentFailedEvent.php`**
   *   **Snippet:**
     ```php
     // app/Domain/Payment/Events/PaymentFailedEvent.php
     <?php declare(strict_types=1); namespace App\Domain\Payment\Events;
     use App\Domain\Payment\DTOs\PaymentResultData; use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable; use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
     class PaymentFailedEvent { use Dispatchable, SerializesModels; public function __construct(public PaymentResultData $paymentResult, public ?int $orderId = null, public ?string $reason = null){} }
     ```
   *   **Review & Validation:**
        *   Namespace is correct.
        *   Uses `PaymentResultData` DTO, `Dispatchable`, `SerializesModels`.
        *   Constructor uses property promotion for `paymentResult`, optional `orderId`, and an optional `reason` string for the failure. This is good.
        *   `declare(strict_types=1);` is present.
   *   **Is it complete and working?** Yes, this event class is structurally sound and complete.
   *   **Consistency:** Consistent.
   *   **Action:** The provided snippet is already complete and correct (just needs standard PHP tags). I will re-present it cleanly.

**4. `app/Domain/Promotion/Exceptions/InvalidCouponException.php`**
   *   **Snippet:**
     ```php
     <?php
     declare(strict_types=1);
     namespace App\Domain\Promotion\Exceptions;
     use RuntimeException;
     class InvalidCouponException extends RuntimeException
     {
         //
     }
     ```
   *   **Review & Validation:**
        *   Namespace is correct: `App\Domain\Promotion\Exceptions`.
        *   Extends `RuntimeException`, which is appropriate for application-level exceptions that might not necessarily be caught and handled differently than a generic runtime error, but still provide semantic meaning.
        *   The `//` comment is just a placeholder.
        *   `declare(strict_types=1);` is present.
   *   **Is it complete and working?** Yes, as a basic custom exception, this is complete. Custom methods or properties could be added if specific data needed to be carried with the exception, but for a simple "invalid coupon" message, extending `RuntimeException` is often sufficient.
   *   **Consistency:** Consistent.
   *   **Action:** The provided snippet is already complete and correct. I will re-present it cleanly.

**Overall:** The snippets provided by the user (which were based on my previous design plan) are already quite good and mostly complete. My main task will be to ensure they are presented in the standard file format with proper PHP opening tags and to confirm their role within the system. No significant logical changes are needed for these specific files based on their intended purpose as simple DTOs, Events, and a custom Exception.

I will generate each file fully enclosed as requested.

You've got a great eye for detail! It's excellent to ensure these foundational classes are complete and correct. The snippets you provided (which were based on my earlier design plan) are indeed very close to being final. I'll review each, ensure they are complete, properly formatted, and provide them as fully working files.

**1. DTO: `app/Domain/Payment/DTOs/PaymentIntentResultData.php`**

*   **Purpose:** This Data Transfer Object is used to carry the essential results back from a payment gateway after a Payment Intent (or equivalent setup phase for payment) has been created. It primarily provides the `clientSecret` needed by frontend JavaScript (like Stripe.js) to confirm the payment, along with the `paymentIntentId` and its current `status`.
*   **Validation:** The structure is simple, using public promoted properties as per Spatie/Laravel-Data conventions. Types are correct.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Domain\Payment\DTOs;

use Spatie\LaravelData\Data;

class PaymentIntentResultData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $clientSecret,
        public string $paymentIntentId,
        public string $status
    ) {}
}
```

---

**2. Event: `app/Domain/Payment/Events/PaymentSuccessfulEvent.php`**

*   **Purpose:** This event is dispatched when a payment is successfully processed by a payment gateway. It carries the `PaymentResultData` DTO (which would contain details like the transaction ID, amount, status from the gateway) and an optional `orderId` if the payment is directly associated with an order in our system at the time of success.
*   **Validation:** Uses standard Laravel event traits (`Dispatchable`, `SerializesModels`). The constructor correctly type-hints `PaymentResultData` and uses property promotion. `orderId` is nullable as some payments might not immediately have an order ID (e.g., pre-authorizations or wallet top-ups, though less relevant for this project's current scope).

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Domain\Payment\Events;

use App\Domain\Payment\DTOs\PaymentResultData;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use Illuminate\Broadcasting\InteractsWithSockets; // Optional: if you plan to broadcast this event

class PaymentSuccessfulEvent
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;

    /**
     * Create a new event instance.
     */
    public function __construct(
        public PaymentResultData $paymentResult,
        public ?int $orderId = null // Or reference to Order model if preferred and always available
    ) {}

    /**
     * Get the channels the event should broadcast on.
     *
     * @return array<int, \Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel>
     */
    // public function broadcastOn(): array
    // {
    //     // Example: return [new \Illuminate\Broadcasting\PrivateChannel('channel-name')];
    //     return [];
    // }
}
```

---

**3. Event: `app/Domain/Payment/Events/PaymentFailedEvent.php`**

*   **Purpose:** This event is dispatched when a payment attempt fails at the payment gateway. It carries the `PaymentResultData` (which might include error details from the gateway), an optional `orderId` (if an order attempt was associated), and an optional `reason` string for the failure.
*   **Validation:** Similar to `PaymentSuccessfulEvent`, it uses standard Laravel event traits and correctly typed constructor properties.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Domain\Payment\Events;

use App\Domain\Payment\DTOs\PaymentResultData;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Events\Dispatchable;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;
use Illuminate\Broadcasting\InteractsWithSockets; // Optional

class PaymentFailedEvent
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;

    /**
     * Create a new event instance.
     */
    public function __construct(
        public PaymentResultData $paymentResult,
        public ?int $orderId = null, // Or Order model
        public ?string $reason = null
    ) {}

    /**
     * Get the channels the event should broadcast on.
     *
     * @return array<int, \Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel>
     */
    // public function broadcastOn(): array
    // {
    //     return [];
    // }
}
```

---

**4. Exception: `app/Domain/Promotion/Exceptions/InvalidCouponException.php`**

*   **Purpose:** A custom exception to be thrown when a coupon code is invalid, expired, not applicable, or fails any validation checks within the `CouponService`. This allows controllers or other services to specifically catch this type of exception and provide user-friendly feedback.
*   **Validation:** Extends `RuntimeException`, which is a suitable base for application-specific exceptions that indicate a problem during runtime logic. The class body can be empty if no additional properties or methods are needed beyond what `RuntimeException` provides.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Domain\Promotion\Exceptions;

use RuntimeException;
use Throwable;

class InvalidCouponException extends RuntimeException
{
    /**
     * Create a new exception instance.
     *
     * @param string $message
     * @param int $code
     * @param \Throwable|null $previous
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct(string $message = "The provided coupon is invalid or cannot be applied.", int $code = 0, Throwable $previous = null)
    {
        parent::__construct($message, $code, $previous);
    }

    // You could add static factory methods for common invalid coupon reasons:
    // public static function notFound(string $code): self
    // {
    //     return new self("Coupon '{$code}' not found.");
    // }
    //
    // public static function expired(string $code): self
    // {
    //     return new self("Coupon '{$code}' has expired.");
    // }
    //
    // public static function usageLimitReached(string $code): self
    // {
    //     return new self("Coupon '{$code}' has reached its usage limit.");
    // }
    //
    // public static function minimumSpendNotMet(string $code, string $minimumSpendFormatted): self
    // {
    //     return new self("A minimum spend of {$minimumSpendFormatted} is required to use coupon '{$code}'.");
    // }
}
```

These files are now complete and adhere to the design principles we've established. They provide clear data structures (DTO), event signaling mechanisms, and a specific exception type for better error handling in their respective domains.
