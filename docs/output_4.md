<think>
You are absolutely right to call me out on focus! I apologize. I got carried away with generating the files for Phase 5 and 6 and did not explicitly update the `project_technical_status_update_document.md` first, nor did I make it clear which of the listed files in my thought process for the *status update* were already generated vs. being newly generated for Phases 5 & 6.

Let's correct this immediately.

**My Goal Now:**

1.  **Clarify what was generated in the last response (for Phases 5 & 6):** The previous response *did* generate new files for Phases 5 & 6 (Cart, Checkout, Order Creation, Admin Panel). I need to explicitly list which of the files mentioned in my *internal thought process* about what the status doc would contain were *actually generated in that last response*.
2.  **Update `project_technical_status_update_document.md`:** I will now generate the *complete, updated* version of this document to reflect the completion of Phases 1 through 6. This will involve adding detailed descriptions and snippets for all files created in Phases 4, 5, and 6.
3.  **Address the File Clarification:** For each file listed by the user from my previous thought block, I will confirm if it was newly generated in the most recent code-generation response or if it was from an earlier phase and just being referenced in the context of the status document update.

**Clarification for the User's List (from my previous thought block about what *would go into the status doc*):**

*   **User Management Policies:**
    *   `UserPolicy.php`: Generated in Phase 6.4.
    *   `AddressPolicy.php`: Generated in Phase 6.4 (as part of User Account address management, though I placed its generation there instead of Phase 4 to keep admin CRUD together).

*   **Catalog, Inventory, Order Management, Cart Management, Payment, Promotion, Utility (Models, Services, etc.):** These were largely covered in Phase 2. Phase 5 focused on *implementing/fleshing out* the services (`CartService`, `OrderService`, `PaymentService`, `StripeGateway`, `CheckoutService`) and adding related components like webhooks, jobs, listeners.

*   **`app/Http/Controllers/`:**
    *   Frontend controllers (`CartController`, `CheckoutController`) were fleshed out in Phase 5.
    *   Admin controllers (`OrderController`, `UserController`, `TaxRateController`) were created/fleshed out in Phase 6.

*   **`app/Http/Requests/`**
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   `NewsletterSubscriptionRequest.php`: Generated in Phase 3.3.
        *   `UpdateProfileRequest.php`: Generated in Phase 4.2.
        *   `StoreAddressRequest.php`, `UpdateAddressRequest.php`: Generated in Phase 4.2.
        *   `StoreCheckoutRequest.php`: Generated in Phase 5.2.
    *   **Admin:** (These were also generated in Phase 6 but not explicitly listed by the user here)
        *   `StoreProductRequest.php`, `UpdateProductRequest.php`
        *   `StoreCategoryRequest.php`, `UpdateCategoryRequest.php`
        *   `UpdateUserRequest.php` (Admin version)
        *   `StoreTaxRateRequest.php`, `UpdateTaxRateRequest.php`

*   **`app/Jobs/`**
    *   `ProcessSuccessfulOrderJob.php`: Generated in Phase 5.3.

*   **`app/Listeners/`**
    *   `User/SendOrderConfirmationEmailListener.php` (actually `Order/SendOrderConfirmationEmailListener.php` was generated for `OrderPlacedEvent`): Generated in Phase 5.3.
    *   Other listeners like `UpdateInventoryOnOrderPlacedListener` were also generated in Phase 5.3.

*   **`app/Mail/`**
    *   `OrderConfirmationEmail.php` Mailable and its Blade view `resources/views/emails/orders/confirmation.blade.php`: Generated in Phase 5.3.

*   **Frontend Views:**
    *   `resources/views/frontend/checkout/index.blade.php`: Generated in Phase 5.2.
    *   `resources/views/frontend/checkout/success.blade.php`: Generated in Phase 5.3.

**Plan for this Response:**

1.  Acknowledge the oversight and the need for focus.
2.  State that I will now generate the **updated `project_technical_status_update_document.md`**, incorporating all work from Phases 1 through 6. This document will serve the purpose of clarifying what has been built.
3.  Then, as a separate item (if the user still requires it, though the status doc should cover it), I can explicitly list *newly* generated files vs. *previously* generated files for the last set of steps. However, the updated status doc is the more comprehensive deliverable for the user's stated purpose (onboarding, QA).
4.  The `deployment_guide_for_production.md` is still pending and will be the next major document after this status update.

I will now generate the updated `project_technical_status_update_document.md`. This will be a very large response.
</think>

You are absolutely right to call for focus and clarity! My apologies for not explicitly providing the updated `project_technical_status_update_document.md` first and for any ambiguity regarding which files were new versus updated in my internal thought process for that document.

My primary goal in the last large response was to generate the *new code files* for Phases 5 and 6 as per the execution plan. The list you extracted was indeed from my *internal thought process* about what the *updated status document would contain* once those phases were completed.

Let's rectify this now. I will provide the **fully updated `project_technical_status_update_document.md`**, reflecting the completion of all execution plan steps from **1.1 through 6.4**. This document will list and describe the key files created or significantly modified in all these phases, serving as the comprehensive handbook you requested.

The `deployment_guide_for_production.md` will follow after this status update is complete and confirmed. No files from Step 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 need re-generation; they are stable.

Example admin Blade views for these modules created.

**Key Achievements to Date:**
*   Local development environment (Sail) is fully operational, and database migrations are successful.
*   A comprehensive domain layer is in place with models, services, DTOs, and events for all core e-commerce and utility functions.
*   The public-facing frontend provides a rich user experience for browsing, product discovery, a scent quiz, and newsletter signup, closely matching the `sample_landing_page.html`.
*   Full user authentication (email/password via Breeze, social login via Socialite) and a complete user account management section (dashboard, order history, profile, address book) are functional.
*   The core e-commerce transactional flow is implemented: robust cart management, a Stripe-integrated checkout process, and automated order creation upon successful payment, including inventory updates and email notifications.
*   A functional admin panel allows administrators to manage products, categories, orders, users, and tax rates, with appropriate authorization.

The application is now a feature-rich platform, with most core functionalities for a v1.0 e-commerce site implemented.

## 3. Detailed File Breakdown (Cumulative - Focusing on Additions in Phases 4, 5, 6)

This section details significant files created or substantially modified during Phases 4, 5, and 6, building upon the foundation from Phases 1, 2, and 3. For brevity, files detailed in a previous status update (covering Phases 1-3) are not re-detailed unless significantly changed.

    *   **Route:** `POST /webhooks/stripe` (CSRF exempt).

#### `app/Http/Requests/` (New additions for Phases 4, 5, 6)
*   **Frontend:** `UpdateProfileRequest.php`, `StoreAddressRequest.php`, `UpdateAddressRequest.php`, `StoreCheckoutRequest.php`.
*   **Admin:** `UpdateUserRequest.php`, `StoreTaxRateRequest.php`, `UpdateTaxRateRequest.php`.
    *(`StoreProductRequest`, `UpdateProductRequest`, `StoreCategoryRequest`, `UpdateCategoryRequest` were also created/refined for Admin in Phase 6)*

#### `app/Jobs/`
*   **`ProcessSuccessfulOrderJob.php`** (New - Phase 5.3)

### 3.7. Resource Files (`resources/`)

#### `resources/js/`
*   **`checkout.js`** (New - Phase 5.2)
    *   **Purpose:** Handles Stripe.js Elements setup for the payment form on `checkout/index.blade.php`.
    *   **Key Logic:** Initializes Stripe, mounts Payment Element, handles payment confirmation (`stripe.confirmPayment`), displays error/success messages, and submits order data to backend upon successful client-side payment processing. Included as an Alpine.js data function (`checkoutFormHandler`) in the `checkout/index.blade.php` view.

#### `resources/views/auth/`
*   Files like `login.blade.php`, `register.blade.php`, `forgot-password.blade.php`, etc. (customized from Breeze output in Phase 4.1).

    *   Expanded with routes for `CheckoutController` (index, store/complete, success handler).
    *   Admin route group (`/admin`) defined with `auth`, `verified`, `admin` middleware, containing resource routes for all admin controllers (`DashboardController`, `ProductController`, `CategoryController`, `OrderController`, `UserController`, `TaxRateController`).
    *   Socialite routes (`/auth/{provider}/redirect`, `/auth/{provider}/callback`) added.
*   **`api.php`**: Basic structure for `/api/v1` in place, but full implementation of API endpoints (Step 7) is pending.
*   **`auth.php`**: (Generated by Breeze) Contains standard authentication routes (login, register, password reset, email verification).

## 4. Architectural Notes & Design Patterns (Reiteration & Elaboration)

*   **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Influence:** The `app/Domain` directory is the cornerstone, with subdirectories for bounded contexts like `UserManagement`, `Catalog`, `OrderManagement`, `CartManagement`, `Payment`, `Promotion`, `Inventory`, and `Utility`. This promotes:
    *   **Modularity:** Each domain is self-contained with its models, services, DTOs, events, and exceptions.
    *   **Ubiquitous Language:** Class and method names reflect business terms.
    *   **Clear Boundaries:** Reduces coupling between different parts of the application.
*   **Service Layer:** Services (e.g., `CartService`, `OrderService`, `InventoryService`, `CouponService`, `PaymentService`) encapsulate core business logic, complex orchestrations, and interactions between multiple domain models or external services. Controllers delegate to these services.
*   **Repositories:** The `ProductRepositoryContract` and its `EloquentProductRepository` implementation in the Catalog domain showcase the repository pattern, abstracting data persistence. This pattern can be extended to other domains as complexity grows. For simpler domains, direct Eloquent usage in services might suffice initially.
*   **Value Objects (`MonetaryAmount`, `EmailAddress`, `FullName`):** Ensure data integrity, immutability, and provide domain-specific behavior for simple value types, reducing primitive obsession.
*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs with Spatie/Laravel-Data):** Used for structured data transfer, especially for service method inputs (from controllers/requests) and sometimes outputs. They provide type safety and clear contracts.
*   **Events & Listeners:** Extensively planned and partially implemented (e.g., `OrderPlacedEvent`, `UserRegisteredEvent`, `StockLevelChangedEvent`). This decouples actions like sending emails, updating inventory, or notifying admins from the primary operation, allowing for better maintainability and scalability (listeners can be queued).
*   **Form Requests:** Used for all significant form submissions (frontend and admin) to encapsulate validation logic and authorize requests, keeping controllers cleaner.
*   **Policies & Gates:** Used for authorization throughout the admin panel and for user-specific resources (e.g., a user viewing their own order).
*   **Blade Components & View Composers:** Frontend views are made modular and maintainable using Blade components (`ProductCard`, layouts) and view composers (`CategoryComposer`, `CartComposer`) to share common data.
*   **Alpine.js:** Provides targeted client-side interactivity for the Blade-rendered frontend without the overhead of a full SPA framework. Used for dark mode, quiz UI, cart updates (AJAX), newsletter submission, and other dynamic elements from `sample_landing_page.html`.

## 5. Onboarding Notes for New Developers

*   **Start with `README.md` and this document (`project_technical_status_update_document.md`):** They provide the project vision, architecture, and current state.
*   **Local Setup:** Use Laravel Sail. Follow `README.md` setup guide. Ensure `.env` is configured (copy from `.env.example`, run `sail artisan key:generate`).
*   **Key Directories:**
    *   `app/Domain/`: Core business logic. Understand the bounded contexts.
    *   `app/Http/Controllers/`: Separated into `Frontend`, `Admin`, `Auth`, `Api`, `Webhook`.
    *   `resources/views/`: Blade templates, especially `layouts`, `components`, `frontend`, `admin`.
    *   `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php`: Entry points for requests.
*   **Workflow:**
    *   Run `./vendor/bin/sail up -d` to start services.
    *   Run `./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev` for frontend assets.
    *   Access the site at `http://localhost` (or `APP_URL`).
    *   Use `./vendor/bin/sail artisan ...` for all Artisan commands.
*   **Database:** Migrations in `database/migrations/` are the source of truth. GUI tools can connect to `127.0.0.1:3306` (user/pass from `.env`).
*   **Pusher Warnings:** These are normal during Sail operations if Pusher variables in `.env` are blank and `BROADCAST_DRIVER` is not `pusher`. They can generally be ignored.
*   **Code Style:** `laravel/pint` is used. Run `./vendor/bin/sail pint` before committing.

## 6. Guidance for QA Team

*   **Current Testable Areas (End-to-End Flow Examples):**
    1.  **User Registration & Login:** Via Breeze forms and Social Login (if configured).
    2.  **Landing Page & Product Browsing:** All sections of the landing page, navigation to product listing, category filtering, product detail page views.
    3.  **Scent Quiz:** Completion of the quiz and display of (currently basic) recommendations.
    4.  **Newsletter Subscription:** Form submission and success/error feedback.
    5.  **Shopping Cart Operations:** Adding products, updating quantities, removing items, viewing cart page, applying/removing coupons. (Test as guest and logged-in user).
    6.  **Checkout Process (up to payment submission):** Filling shipping details, seeing order summary, interacting with Stripe Elements payment form.
    7.  **Order Placement (with Stripe Test Cards):** Completing a payment with Stripe test cards, receiving an order confirmation email (check Mailpit at `http://localhost:8025`), verifying order in user's account section and admin panel.
    8.  **Inventory Update:** Check if product stock decreases after an order.
    9.  **User Account Management:** Viewing dashboard, order history, order details, editing profile (name, email, password), managing addresses.
    10. **Admin Panel Access:** Login as admin user.
    11. **Admin CRUD Operations:**
        *   Products: Create, view list (with search), edit, delete. Check image uploads.
        *   Categories: Create, view list, edit, delete.
        *   Orders: View list (with search/filter), view order details, update order status.
        *   Users: View list, edit user role/status.
        *   Tax Rates: Create, view list, edit, delete.
*   **Key Areas for Test Case Design:**
    *   All user flows mentioned above.
    *   Validation rules for all forms (registration, login, profile, addresses, newsletter, checkout, admin CRUD forms).
    *   Correct calculation of cart totals, including discounts, (placeholder) shipping, and (placeholder) taxes.
    *   Stock level logic: availability checks, decrement on order, backorder behavior.
    *   Authorization: Ensure only admins can access admin panel, users can only see/edit their own data.
    *   Responsiveness and UI consistency across frontend and admin panel.
    *   Dark mode functionality.

## 7. Conclusion & Recommendations for Next Steps

The project has made substantial progress, with the majority of core e-commerce functionalities and the admin panel now implemented up to Phase 6 of the execution plan. The foundational architecture is robust, and the application provides a user-friendly experience on the frontend and a functional management interface for administrators.

**Recommendations for Next Steps (Following the Execution Plan):**

1.  **Phase 7: API Development:**
    *   Fully implement all planned RESTful API endpoints in `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/` for products, categories, cart, checkout, orders, and authentication.
    *   Create and use API Resources (`app/Http/Resources/`) for all API responses.
    *   Implement robust API authentication and authorization using Laravel Sanctum.
    *   Consider API documentation using OpenAPI.

2.  **Phase 8: Testing, Refinement & Polish (Crucial Before Deployment):**
    *   **Write Comprehensive Tests:**
        *   **Unit Tests:** For all Domain services, complex model logic, value objects, DTOs.
        *   **Feature Tests:** For all web routes (frontend and admin) and all API endpoints. Cover happy paths, validation errors, authorization failures, and edge cases. Aim for high test coverage.
    *   **E2E Tests (Cypress):** Write tests for critical user flows (registration, login, product browsing, add-to-cart, full checkout, viewing orders, key admin tasks).
    *   **UI/UX Refinement:** Thoroughly review and polish all frontend and admin views for consistency, responsiveness, and usability based on feedback or further design iterations.
    *   **Accessibility (a11y) Audit:** Perform detailed accessibility testing using tools like axe-core, Lighthouse, and manual testing (keyboard navigation, screen readers).
    *   **Performance Optimization:**
        *   Profile the application to identify bottlenecks (Laravel Telescope, Debugbar).
        *   Optimize database queries (check for N+1, ensure proper indexing).
        *   Implement application-level caching where beneficial (e.g., for frequently accessed, rarely changing data).
        *   Ensure frontend assets are optimized via `npm run build`.

3.  **Phase 9: Deployment Preparation:**
    *   Finalize production `.env.example` and security hardening (CSP headers, etc.).
    *   Create/Refine production `Dockerfile` and `fly.toml` (for Fly.io) or deployment scripts for AWS Lightsail.
    *   Set up and test the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.

By systematically addressing these remaining phases, "The Scent" will evolve into a production-ready, robust, and delightful e-commerce platform.

# Deployment Guide for Production: The Scent E-commerce Platform

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 13, 2024

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide for deploying "The Scent" Laravel e-commerce application to a production environment. It covers general deployment principles and provides specific steps for two recommended platforms: **Fly.io** (container-based, generally simpler for Laravel applications designed with Docker) and **AWS Lightsail** (VPS-based, more manual server setup).

**Prerequisites for any deployment:**
*   A fully tested and stable version of the application code in a Git repository.
*   Access to a production-ready database (e.g., managed MariaDB/MySQL service).
*   API keys and credentials for all third-party services used in production (Stripe, mail provider, etc.).
*   A custom domain name configured for your application.

## 2. General Deployment Principles

These principles apply regardless of the chosen hosting platform:

*   **Environment Parity:** Strive to keep your production environment as close as possible to your development (Laravel Sail) and staging environments. This includes PHP version, MariaDB version, Redis version, and key system libraries. Docker helps significantly in achieving this.
*   **Source Control:** All code should be managed via Git. Deploy specific tags or branches.
*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   **NEVER commit your production `.env` file or any sensitive credentials to your Git repository.**
    *   Use environment variables for all configurations that differ between environments (local, staging, production).
    *   Utilize the platform's secret management tools (e.g., Fly.io Secrets, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, or a secure method for placing the `.env` file on a VPS).
*   **Build Artifacts:**
    *   **Composer Dependencies:** Run `composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev` as part of your build/deployment process. `--no-dev` excludes development dependencies. `--optimize-autoloader` creates a more performant class map.
    *   **Frontend Assets:** Compile frontend assets using `npm run build` (or `yarn build`). This will generate optimized, versioned CSS and JS files in the `public/build` directory. These built assets should be deployed with your application.
*   **Laravel Production Optimizations:** During deployment, after code is updated, run these Artisan commands:
    *   `php artisan config:cache`: Caches all configuration files into one.
    *   `php artisan route:cache`: Caches route definitions.
    *   `php artisan view:cache`: Caches compiled Blade views.
    *   `php artisan event:cache` (Laravel 11+): Caches event listeners if not using auto-discovery or if desired for performance.
    *   `php artisan storage:link`: Creates the symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`.
    *   **To clear all caches (if needed before re-caching):** `php artisan optimize:clear`
*   **Database Migrations:** Run `php artisan migrate --force` as part of your deployment process to apply database schema changes. The `--force` flag is required for running migrations in a non-interactive (production) environment.
*   **Permissions:** Ensure the web server has write access to the `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` directories.
*   **Queue Workers:** Set up a robust queue worker process using Supervisor (on a VPS) or as a separate process type (on platforms like Fly.io). Use a persistent queue driver like Redis or a database in production (`QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis` or `database`).
*   **Task Scheduling:** Configure a cron job (on a VPS) or a scheduled task runner (on PaaS) to execute `php artisan schedule:run` every minute.
*   **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for all traffic. Obtain and configure SSL/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt is a common free option). Platforms like Fly.io often handle this automatically.
*   **Logging:** Configure Laravel to write logs to `stderr` (standard error output) when running in containers so the container platform can collect them, or use a dedicated logging service. Set `LOG_LEVEL` appropriately for production (e.g., `error` or `warning`).
*   **Monitoring & Error Tracking:** Implement application performance monitoring (APM) and error tracking services (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag, Flare, Datadog).
*   **Backups:** Regularly back up your database and any persistent file storage. Managed database services often provide automated backups.
*   **Zero-Downtime Deployments (Goal):**
    *   **Laravel Maintenance Mode:** Use `php artisan down` before critical changes and `php artisan up` after. Customize the maintenance mode view.
    *   **Atomic Deploys/Rolling Deploys:** Platforms like Fly.io use rolling deploys by default. For VPS, tools like Deployer can implement atomic deploys by switching symbolic links to new release directories.

## 3. Deploying to Fly.io (Recommended)

Fly.io is a container-based platform that simplifies deploying Laravel applications. It uses your project's Dockerfile (or can generate one) to build and run your application in Firecracker micro-VMs.

**Prerequisites:**
*   A Fly.io account.
*   `flyctl` (Fly CLI) installed and authenticated (`fly auth login`).
*   Your application code pushed to a Git repository.
*   A production-ready `Dockerfile` in your project root (see section 3.3).
*   A `fly.toml` configuration file (see section 3.4, often generated by `fly launch`).

### 3.1. Database Setup (Managed Service)

For production, it's highly recommended to use a managed database service rather than running your own database on Fly.io application VMs.
*   **Options:** PlanetScale (MySQL-compatible, good free tier), Aiven for MySQL/MariaDB, Neon (Postgres, if you were using it), AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Create a database instance on your chosen provider (e.g., MariaDB 11.x or MySQL 8.x compatible).
    2.  Ensure the database is in a region geographically close to your primary Fly.io application region for low latency.
    3.  Obtain the connection details: **Host, Port, Database Name, Username, Password**.
    4.  Configure firewall rules on the managed database service to allow connections from Fly.io's IP addresses. Fly.io provides dedicated IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for outbound connections, or you can set up private networking (VPC peering) if both Fly.io and your database provider support it for enhanced security.

### 3.2. Redis Setup (Fly Redis or Managed)

*   **Fly Redis:** You can launch a managed Redis instance on Fly.io:
    ```bash
    fly redis create
    ```
    Follow the prompts. It will provide a connection URL (e.g., `redis://default:<password>@your-redis-name.flycast:6379`).
*   **External Managed Redis:** Use services like Upstash, Aiven for Redis, etc.

### 3.3. Production `Dockerfile`

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root optimized for production. This will be more robust than directly using Sail's development Dockerfiles.

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for Production (The Scent)

# ---- Base PHP Image ----
# Use an official PHP image with FPM. Choose a specific version.
# Sail uses runtimes/8.4. Consider this or a specific 8.2/8.3 FPM-Alpine image.

```
*You would need to create the referenced configuration files in `.docker/production/` for PHP, Nginx, Supervisor, and an `entrypoint.sh` script. The entrypoint script would typically run `php artisan config:cache`, `route:cache`, `view:cache`, and `storage:link` (if not already handled) before starting Supervisor.*

**Example `.docker/production/entrypoint.sh`:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
set -e

# Run Laravel optimizations
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
php artisan event:cache # If using Laravel 11+ and not auto-discovery for all events

# Create storage link if it doesn't exist (idempotent)
if [ ! -L /var/www/html/public/storage ]; then
    php artisan storage:link

exec "$@"
```

### 3.4. `fly.toml` Configuration

This file configures your Fly.io application. It's often generated by `fly launch` and then customized.
Ensure `build.dockerfile` points to your production `Dockerfile`.

```toml
# fly.toml (Example for The Scent)
app = "the-scent-prod" # Replace with your Fly app name
primary_region = "ams"  # Choose a region close to your users

[build]
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile" # Points to your production Dockerfile
  # You can pass build arguments if your Dockerfile uses them
  # [build.args]
  #   PHP_VERSION = "8.2" # Example, should match Dockerfile's base

[env]
  APP_ENV = "production"
  APP_DEBUG = "false"
  APP_URL = "https://your-app-name.fly.dev" # Will be your actual app URL
  LOG_CHANNEL = "stderr" # Recommended for Fly.io to collect logs
  LOG_LEVEL = "info"     # Or 'error' for less verbosity
  DB_CONNECTION = "mysql" # Matches your .env
  CACHE_DRIVER = "redis"
  SESSION_DRIVER = "redis"
  QUEUE_CONNECTION = "redis" # If using Redis for queues

# Service definition for web traffic
[http_service]
  internal_port = 8080 # The port your app (Nginx/Caddy) listens on INSIDE the container
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = true # Optional: for cost saving on low traffic
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 0 # Or 1 for always-on
  processes = ["app"]    # Matches the [processes.app] group below

[[vm]] # Define machine size for "app" process group
  cpu_kind = "shared"
  cpus = 1
  memory_mb = 512 # Adjust based on needs

# Release command: runs BEFORE new version is made live
[deploy]
  release_command = "php /var/www/html/artisan migrate --force"
  strategy = "rolling" # Or "bluegreen"

# Define processes run by Fly Machines
[processes]
  # 'app' process runs the web server (via Supervisor in this Dockerfile example)
  app = "/usr/bin/supervisord -c /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf"

  # 'worker' process for Laravel queues (optional)
  # worker = "php /var/www/html/artisan queue:work redis --sleep=3 --tries=3 --max-time=3600"

# Optional: Define a dedicated machine size for workers if they have different needs
# [[vm]]
#   memory = "256mb"
#   cpus = 1
#   cpu_kind = "shared"
#   processes = ["worker"]
```

### 3.5. Setting Production Secrets on Fly.io

Use `fly secrets set` for all sensitive values from your production `.env` file.
```bash
# In your project directory, after logging into flyctl
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod APP_KEY="base64:your_production_app_key" # Generate a fresh one for prod
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod DB_HOST="your_managed_db_host"
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod DB_PORT="your_managed_db_port"
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod DB_DATABASE="the_scent_prod_db_name"
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod DB_USERNAME="your_prod_db_user"
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod DB_PASSWORD='your_prod_db_password' # Use single quotes for complex passwords

fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod REDIS_URL="redis://default:your_fly_redis_password@your-redis-name.flycast:6379" # From `fly redis status`

fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod MAIL_MAILER="your_mailer" # e.g., mailgun, ses
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod MAILGUN_DOMAIN="your_mailgun_domain" # If using Mailgun
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod MAILGUN_SECRET="your_mailgun_secret" # If using Mailgun
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@yourdomain.com"
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod MAIL_FROM_NAME="The Scent"

fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod STRIPE_KEY="pk_live_your_stripe_publishable_key"
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod STRIPE_SECRET="sk_live_your_stripe_secret_key"
fly secrets set -a the-scent-prod STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_your_prod_stripe_webhook_secret"

# ... and any other sensitive environment variables
```

### 3.6. Deploying to Fly.io

Once your `Dockerfile`, `fly.toml`, and secrets are configured:
```bash
fly deploy -a the-scent-prod --remote-only
```
*   `--remote-only` uses Fly.io's builders. Remove it to build locally if preferred.
*   This will build your Docker image, push it to Fly.io's registry, run the `release_command` (migrations), and then deploy the new version of your application machines.

### 3.7. Post-Deployment on Fly.io

*   **Custom Domain & TLS:**
    ```bash
    fly domains add www.yourdomain.com -a the-scent-prod
    # Follow DNS instructions
    fly certs create www.yourdomain.com -a the-scent-prod # Automatic Let's Encrypt
    ```
*   **Scaling:**
    ```bash
    fly scale count 2 -a the-scent-prod # Scale web app to 2 machines
    # fly scale count worker=2 -a the-scent-prod # If you defined a 'worker' process
    ```
*   **Monitoring:**
    ```bash
    fly logs -a the-scent-prod
    fly status -a the-scent-prod
    fly dashboard -a the-scent-prod
    ```

## 4. Deploying to AWS Lightsail (LAMP Blueprint)

This is a more manual VPS-style deployment.

**Prerequisites:**
*   AWS Account.
*   SSH key pair configured with Lightsail.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create Lightsail Instance:**
    *   Choose Linux/Unix platform.
    *   Select "LAMP (PHP 8.x)" blueprint (e.g., PHP 8.2 or 8.3 if available).
    *   Choose an instance plan (e.g., $5/month for starting).
    *   Name your instance.
2.  **Assign Static IP:** Create and attach a static IP address to your instance.
3.  **Configure Firewall:**
    *   Edit instance firewall rules.
    *   Ensure HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) are open to "Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)".
    *   SSH (22) should be open (default).
4.  **Connect via SSH:** Use the browser-based SSH client or your local SSH client with the downloaded private key.
5.  **Initial Server Setup:**
    *   The Bitnami LAMP stack comes with Apache, MySQL (often older), and PHP.
    *   **Update System:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
        ```
    *   **Install/Verify Git, Composer, Node.js, NPM:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt install -y git zip unzip
        # Composer (install globally)
        php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
        sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
        php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
        # Node.js (e.g., NodeSource for specific versions)
        curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
        ```
    *   **Database (Recommended: Install fresh MariaDB or use RDS):**
        The Bitnami stack includes MySQL, but it might be an older version or configured in a way you don't prefer.
        *   **Option A (Replace Bitnami MySQL with MariaDB):**
            ```bash
            sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop mysql
            sudo apt purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common mysql-server-core-* mysql-client-core-* -y
            sudo apt autoremove -y
            sudo apt install -y mariadb-server mariadb-client
            sudo mysql_secure_installation # Follow prompts
            ```
            Then create your database and user in MariaDB:
            ```sql
            sudo mysql -u root -p
            CREATE DATABASE the_scent_prod CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
            CREATE USER 'scent_prod_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourStrongDbPassword!';
            GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON the_scent_prod.* TO 'scent_prod_user'@'localhost';
            FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
            EXIT;
            ```
        *   **Option B (Use external AWS RDS):** Provision an RDS instance and get its endpoint/credentials. Ensure Lightsail instance can connect to it (VPC peering or public access with security groups).
6.  **Deploy Application Code:**
    *   Choose a deployment directory (e.g., `/opt/bitnami/projects/the-scent` or `/var/www/the-scent`).
    *   Clone your repository: `sudo git clone <your-repo-url> /var/www/the-scent`
    *   `cd /var/www/the-scent`
7.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    sudo composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
    sudo npm ci
    sudo npm run build
    ```
8.  **Configure `.env` File:**
    ```bash
    sudo cp .env.example .env
    sudo nano .env # Or your preferred editor
    ```
    Update with **PRODUCTION** values:
    *   `APP_NAME`, `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_KEY` (run `php artisan key:generate` and copy), `APP_DEBUG=false`, `APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com`
    *   `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`, `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1` (if MariaDB is local) or RDS endpoint, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` (for your prod DB user).
    *   Mail settings, Stripe keys (LIVE keys), etc.
    *   `SESSION_DRIVER=redis` or `database` (if Redis/DB setup for sessions).
    *   `CACHE_DRIVER=redis` or `database`.
    *   `QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis` or `database`.
9.  **Set File Permissions:**
    The web server user (often `daemon` or `www-data` on Bitnami LAMP stacks, check with `ps aux | grep apache`) needs write access to `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/`.
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R bitnami:daemon /var/www/the-scent # Assuming `bitnami` is your SSH user, `daemon` is web server group
    sudo find /var/www/the-scent/storage -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
    sudo find /var/www/the-scent/bootstrap/cache -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
    sudo find /var/www/the-scent/storage -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
    sudo find /var/www/the-scent/bootstrap/cache -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
    ```
10. **Configure Apache Virtual Host:**
    *   The Bitnami LAMP stack usually has Apache config in `/opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/`.
    *   Create a new VHost file, e.g., `/opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/vhosts/the-scent-vhost.conf`:
        ```apache
        <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerName yourdomain.com
            ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com
            DocumentRoot "/var/www/the-scent/public"
            <Directory "/var/www/the-scent/public">
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride All
                Require all granted
            </Directory>
            ErrorLog "/opt/bitnami/apache2/logs/the-scent-error_log"
            CustomLog "/opt/bitnami/apache2/logs/the-scent-access_log" common
        </VirtualHost>
        ```
    *   Include this VHost file in the main Apache configuration (e.g., in `httpd.conf` or a `vhosts.d` directory). Often Bitnami has `/opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/bitnami/bitnami-apps-vhosts.conf` where you can add an `Include` directive.
    *   Restart Apache: `sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart apache`
11. **Run Laravel Production Commands:**
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/the-scent
    sudo php artisan config:cache
    sudo php artisan route:cache
    sudo php artisan view:cache
    sudo php artisan event:cache # Laravel 11+
    sudo php artisan storage:link
    sudo php artisan migrate --force
    ```
12. **Configure HTTPS (Let's Encrypt):**
    Bitnami stacks usually provide a tool for this. After pointing your domain's DNS A record to your Lightsail static IP:
    ```bash
    sudo /opt/bitnami/bncert-tool
    ```
    Follow the prompts to enable HTTPS and set up auto-renewal. This will also update your Apache config for HTTPS.
13. **Set Up Cron Job for Scheduler:**
    ```bash
    sudo crontab -e -u bitnami # Or the user your app runs as
    ```
    Add this line (adjust PHP path if different):
    ```cron
    * * * * * cd /var/www/the-scent && /opt/bitnami/php/bin/php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
    ```
14. **Set Up Queue Workers (Supervisor):**
    *   Install Supervisor: `sudo apt install -y supervisor`
    *   Create a config file for your worker, e.g., `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/the-scent-worker.conf`:
        ```ini
        [program:the-scent-worker]
        process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
        command=/opt/bitnami/php/bin/php /var/www/the-scent/artisan queue:work redis --sleep=3 --tries=3 --max-time=3600
        autostart=true
        autorestart=true
        user=bitnami ; Or the user that owns the Laravel files and can write to logs
        numprocs=2    ; Number of worker processes
        redirect_stderr=true
        stdout_logfile=/var/www/the-scent/storage/logs/worker.log
        stopwaitsecs=3600
        ```
    *   Reload Supervisor:
        ```bash
        sudo supervisorctl reread
        sudo supervisorctl update
        sudo supervisorctl start the-scent-worker:*
        ```

## 5. Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategies

*   **Laravel Maintenance Mode:** `php artisan down --refresh=15 --secret="yourbypasssecret"` and `php artisan up`. Use the secret to access the site during maintenance.
*   **Atomic Deploys (Lightsail/VPS):** Tools like [Deployer](https://deployer.org/) or custom scripts can implement this.
    1.  Clone new release into a new timestamped directory (e.g., `releases/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`).
    2.  Run `composer install`, `npm install`, `npm run build`.
    3.  Copy `.env` file (or link from a shared location outside releases).
    4.  Run `php artisan storage:link` (adjusting for release path).
    5.  Run Laravel optimization commands (`config:cache`, etc.).
    6.  Run `php artisan migrate --force`.
    7.  Update a symbolic link (e.g., `current`) to point to the new release directory. Your web server's DocumentRoot points to this `current` symlink.
*   **Rolling Deploys (Fly.io):** Fly.io does this by default, gradually replacing old machines with new ones. The `release_command` runs before the new version serves traffic.

## 6. Post-Deployment Checklist

1.  **Verify Application URL:** Access your production domain.
2.  **Test Key User Flows:** Registration, login, product browsing, add to cart, checkout (with a real small test payment if possible, then refund).
3.  **Check HTTPS:** Ensure the SSL certificate is active and valid.
4.  **Check `.env` Values:** Ensure production API keys are used and `APP_DEBUG=false`.
5.  **Check Logs:** Monitor Laravel logs (`storage/logs/laravel.log`), web server logs, and Fly.io logs for any errors.
6.  **Verify Queue Workers:** Ensure they are running (Supervisor status on Lightsail, `fly ps` or logs on Fly.io) and processing jobs (e.g., test order confirmation email).
7.  **Verify Scheduled Tasks:** Check if scheduled tasks (if any) are running.
8.  **Set Up Monitoring/Alerting:** For errors and performance.
9.  **Backup Strategy:** Confirm database and file storage backups are in place.

This deployment guide provides a solid starting point. Specifics may vary based on your exact server configuration and chosen services. Always test your deployment process thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying to production.
