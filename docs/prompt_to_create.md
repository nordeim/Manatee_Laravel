You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

I need your help to build a new e-commerce platform based on the information in the attached files - sample database schema, current project directory structure, sample UI design in the sample landing page HTML and project description in README.md.

Carefully review the information provided, then help me design and code the whole e-commerce platform based on the specified technology framework and database schema. But first, I want you to think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly with long chain of thoughts the various implementation options to build a really useful and full featured e-commerce platform that suits my business. Then choose the best implementation option to build the codebase. Before doing anything plan carefully the complete project file directory structure with the .php and config files needed, then create a detailed technical design document to spell out in detail the project file structure and listing out all the .php and config files that you plan to build with the filename and purpose and interfaces. Create the detailed technical design specification document with at least 6000 words, with project file structure and files, specifying each file's filename, purpose and code snippets. enclose the `technical_design_specification_document.md` in ```markdown and ``` tags. Next create a detail execution plan to specify in clear and logical sequence, the steps to build the files mentioned in the detailed technical design specification document. create the execution plan as a markdown document within ```markdown and ``` tags. In the execution plan document, spell out the files to be created in each step, goal and objectives for each step and a checklist to ensure each step meets its goal.

---
you stopped half way generating the technical design specification document. please continue according to your plan.

---
please carefully review the technical design specification document and the execution plan you have created (attached here for your reference). create a complete updated version if need be after careful and systematic validation. then base on the final design, create a complete database schema within ```sql and ``` tags (adapted from the `sample_database_schema.sql.txt` shared earlier). 

---
you have done an awesome job so far! now, use the same rigorous and meticulous methodology / approach to complete step 1 (sub steps 1.1 to 1.3) for me by generating all the specified files for step 1 (enclose each file within respective ```php and ``` tags). after completing all the sub-steps in step 1, review what you have done against the goals and checklist for step 1 in your execution plan and then provide a status update.
