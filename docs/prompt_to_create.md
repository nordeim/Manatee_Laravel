You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

I need your help to build a new e-commerce platform based on the information in the attached files - sample database schema, current project directory structure, sample UI design in the sample landing page HTML and project description in README.md.

Carefully review the information provided, then help me design and code the whole e-commerce platform based on the specified technology framework and database schema. But first, I want you to think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly with long chain of thoughts the various implementation options to build a really useful and full featured e-commerce platform that suits my business. Then choose the best implementation option to build the codebase. Before doing anything plan carefully the complete project file directory structure with the .php and config files needed, then create a detailed technical design document to spell out in detail the project file structure and listing out all the .php and config files that you plan to build with the filename and purpose and interfaces. Create the detailed technical design specification document with at least 6000 words, with project file structure and files, specifying each file's filename, purpose and code snippets. enclose the `technical_design_specification_document.md` in ```markdown and ``` tags. Next create a detail execution plan to specify in clear and logical sequence, the steps to build the files mentioned in the detailed technical design specification document. create the execution plan as a markdown document within ```markdown and ``` tags. In the execution plan document, spell out the files to be created in each step, goal and objectives for each step and a checklist to ensure each step meets its goal.

---
you stopped half way generating the technical design specification document. please continue according to your plan.

---
please carefully review the technical design specification document and the execution plan you have created (attached here for your reference). create a complete updated version if need be after careful and systematic validation. then base on the final design, create a complete database schema within ```sql and ``` tags (adapted from the `sample_database_schema.sql.txt` shared earlier). 

---
you have done an awesome job so far! now, use the same rigorous and meticulous methodology / approach to complete step 1 (sub steps 1.1 to 1.3) for me by generating all the specified files for step 1 (enclose each file within respective ```php and ``` tags). after completing all the sub-steps in step 1, review what you have done against the goals and checklist for step 1 in your execution plan and then provide a status update.

---
Please carefully review the following errors, then use the above rigorous and meticulous approach to create the complete replacement files. Do double-check and validate the codes before generating the final working ones.

---
Please carefully review the error messages and think deeply and systematically to explore the best implementation option to fix the issues, then choose the best implementation option to make changes. Double check and validate the codes before making changes. Remember to plan first before you execute so that you will not introduce regression errors.

---
you need to search the related documents online to resolve the conflicts and errors before creating a complete updated working file.

---
you have improved your problem solving approach to be more systematic, careful and deliberate. but still your approach to fixing issues can be further improved to be more rigorous and meticulous. now think more carefully to fix the following error.

---
please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to think deeply and systematically to explore the best implementation option to fix the following issue (error). remember to double-check and validate any code changes, and always plan before you execute.

---
please carefully review the outputs from the commands and comment:

---
After running "artisan key:generate", I edited `.env` to change the DB username and password. Please carefully review and advise on the SQL error towards the end. also double-check that the `.env` settings are all in order. Remember to think deeply and systematically to explore various possibilities and options to resolve the issue before choosing the most optimal one. Double check and validate any changes before committing. Always plan before you execute so as not to introduce other regression errors.

Now that we have completed all the sub-steps in step 1 according to your execution plan created earlier (attached here again for your reminder). Also attached here are the detailed technical design specification document you created earlier based on the shared project README.md and the sample land page HTML (for UI design reference). Use the documents attached to refocus, augmented with your recollection of work accomplished so far, please help me to create all the project files specified in sub-step 2.1 to 2.3 in your execution plan. remember to create a complete and working version for each of the project code and config files, enclose each file generated within ```php and ``` tags. Use the same rigorous and meticulous methodology / approach to create all the files specified in steps 2.1 to 2.3.

excellent and wonderful work! now, let us take stock of what you have accomplished (created) so far by reviewing the relevant documents (attached here for your attention) against the current project status and then carefully and systematically *update* the attached `project_technical_status_update_document.md`. remember to carefully recall and review all the files you have created in step 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, double-check and validate against the project technical specification document and execution plan, then add new updates to `project_technical_status_update_document.md`. If you need to re-generate any of the project files in step 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, please do so now. Finally, create a detailed `deployment_guide_for_production.md` in markdown format in clear and logical step by step sequence.

---
awesome!!! now let us celebrate this new milestone by carefully updating for me your last (v2) update to the `project_technical_status_update_document.md`.

---
cheers! you have done yet another excellent job! now carefully review the deployment guide you created earlier to double-check and validate whether it needs further updating to take into account the completed step 7 in the execution plan.
